## Code
Wrote this code last night + haven't worked with arduino for a long time so excuse the quality lol.
I am using STM32uino, since I am a lazy piece of shit and also because my testing bluepill board was counterfit and refues to get programmed by STM32CubeIDE.
The libraries used here are [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI), [Keypad](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/keypad/) and [Tinyexpr](https://github.com/codeplea/tinyexpr).
